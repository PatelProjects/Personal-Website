                        Reflecting now, I realize that ever since I was young I was in love with business. Growing up many branches of the business world, such as finance, stocks, projections and accounting received my admiration. However, it wasn't until junior year of high school that I realized that I wanted to pursue this type of career in my future. It was at this point where I realized that above all, business is a field of collaboration. I was always one to work well with a team, and so this pulled me in as I realized that pursuing a career in business was the right choice for me.
